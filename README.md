# TensorFlow_Complete_Guide
This is a Complete guide for all the major concpets in TensorFlow framework for Deeplearning.
**TensorFlow** is a popular framework of machine learning and deep learning. It is a free and open source library which is developed by **Google Brain Team**. It is entirely bassed on Python programming languagee and use for numerical computation and data flow, which makes machine learning faster and easier.

Deep learning techniques are based on neural networks, sometimes referred to as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), which are a subset of machine learning. Their structure and nomenclature are modelled after the human brain, mirroring the communication between organic neurons.

Node layers, which include an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, make up artificial neural networks. Each artificial neuron, or node, is connected to another and has a weight and threshold that go with it. Any node whose output exceeds the defined threshold value is activated and begins providing data to the network's uppermost layer. Otherwise, no data is sent to the network's next tier.

A **Neural Network for Regression** is a type of artificial neural network used to predict conotinuous values, such as prices or weights. Regression neural networks are similar to other ANNs, but optimized to predict values within a range, rather than classifying data into categories.
